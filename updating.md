# Updating the collection

You can keep your copy of the collection up to date to benefit from new API requests and bug fixes by pulling changes from the main collection without having to reimport anything.

## Pull Changes

1. Navigate to the workspace that holds your collection
2. Click on the “three dots” icon next to the “Salesforce CDP APIs” collection and select **Merge Changes** from the menu
