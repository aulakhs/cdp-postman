# Working With Environments To Connect To Multiple CDP Instances

While the variables are stored by default in the collection you can use Postman with [environments](#https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/) to work with multiple CDP instances in parallel.

The pre-request script has been written to determine if an environment has been selected. If it has been, the environment variables will be used for the authorization. By default in Postman the environment variables will supersede the collection level variables. 

> ⚠️  Using environments means that you will store Marketing Cloud credentials in clear in Postman. Do this at your own risk.

- [Configure the Environment](#configure-the-environment)

## Import the Template Environment

1. Using a browser, [sign in to Postman](https://identity.getpostman.com/login)
2. Open the main collection with [this link](https://www.postman.com/salesforce-developers/workspace/salesforce-developers)
3. Select the **Environments** tab (item A in following screenshot)
4. Click **CDP Template Environment** (B)
5. Click on the “three dots” icon on the right (C) and select **Export** from the menu

    This downloads a `CDP Template Environment.postman_environment.json` file.

6. Close the browser tab. We'll continue the installation on the Postman app
7. In the Postman app, click **Import**
8. Drag and drop the JSON file you just downloaded in the gray zone
9. Click **Import**

## Configure the Environment

1. Click on the Environments icon
2. Click on the “three dots” icon on the right of the environment template and select duplicate

    This creates a `CDP Template Environment Copy` template.

3. Click **CDP Template Environment Copy**
4. Rename the environment with something meaningful in relation with your Marketing Cloud instance (e.g.: “Playground 1”)
5. Set values in the **CURRENT VALUE** column for the following variables. If you need instructions for getting these variables go to: [Configure the Collection](install-the-collection.md#configure-the-collection)
